### Hi I'm Shawn ðŸ‘‹

I've worked for over 4 years as a mobile app developer with Flutter.

I'm especially skilled in data visualization for financial services, with experience creating a Flutter library that includes a custom candlestick chart, along with line and pie charts.

I've been writing some posts on my blog. The main topic I focus on in my writing is creating interesting UI/UX and turning it into a Flutter widget.

I've been maintaining a open source project "Localify" which is for shortening localization task.
