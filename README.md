### Hi I'm Shawn ðŸ‘‹

I'm a mobile developer and good at Flutter. I've worked for over 2 years.

I've been writing some posts on my blog. The main topic I focus on in my writing is creating interesting UI/UX and turning it into a Flutter widget. [![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/go_to_the_blog-ffffff?style=for-the-badge&link=https://shawnis.dev/blog)](https://shawnis.dev/blog)

I've been maintaining a open source project "Localify" which is for shortening localization task.
