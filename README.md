### Hi I'm Shawn 👋

I've worked for over 4 years as a mobile app developer with Flutter.

I'm especially skilled in data visualization for financial services, with experience creating a Flutter library that includes a custom candlestick chart, along with line and pie charts.

### What I’m up to

- Rooty (Flutter application)
I’m working on a mobile app called Rooty for vocabulary training.  
Many East Asian languages—like Korean, Japanese, and Chinese—share Chinese characters (한자/漢字/汉字) but use them differently. Rooty leverages these shared character “roots” to help learners make connections across languages and master advanced vocabulary more effectively.

- Blogging
I write some posts on my blog. The main topic I focus on in my writing is creating interesting UI/UX and turning it into a Flutter widget.

- Localify (Flutter package) 
I maintain a Flutter package that automates and simplifies the extraction of localization from Google Spread Sheets to your Flutter project

A Flutter package that automates and simplifies the extraction of localization keys from your Dart code—reducing manual work by over 70% in my team’s last project.
